# cache directory for in-pipeline storage
#
# works with the --deploy mount argument (default)
#
# NOTE: scripts should make assets a+rw otherwise root is needed to
#       clean up cache files (root-full docker, many docker containers
#       run as root)
#
# usage example: dist/pipelines/docker-client-install.sh
#
# NOTE: the usage on docker-client install is outdated as the docker
#       client is automatically instally nowadays, but since, this
#       serves as an example for offline-compatible pipeline runs
#       how a pipeline remote resource can be transparently cached
#       within the project
